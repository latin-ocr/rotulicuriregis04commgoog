means of carrying on the suit, and bearing
the letters of the Prelates, which at once
declared the misconduct of the Monks, and
entreated the Pope to sanction the re-
organization of the Cathedral, hythe intro·
duction os a secular Chapter. During six
months, the Pope suspended the sentence,
to the intent that the Monks might, is they
pleased‚ appear and shew cause against it.
Their poverty incapacitated them from
making their desence, and, as it is said, a
sentence was pronounced, by which they

were expelled 3 but it is by no means oer-
tain that they were legally abolished or sup·

pressed, as pleaded by the canone. The
hood and the amice replaced frock and
cowl. The Canons were installedr and,
the better to efface all recollection of the
former inmates, Bishop Hugh pulled down
the conventual buildings, and rehuilt them
upon a new plan, paying the expences with
the moveable goods of the late community.

It appears, however, from the pleadings
on the roll, that the Monks kept together as
a body, notwithstanding their expulsion3
nor was any legal objection taken by the

Court against their corporate existence.
Similar examples may be found in modern
times, the Monks of La Trappe and the
Nuus of Syon having, though despoiled of
their possessions‚ equally withstood the

Revolution ol France, and the Reformation
