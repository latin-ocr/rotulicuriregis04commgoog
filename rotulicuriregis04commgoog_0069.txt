Lougchamp Bishop of Ely‚ the Clraucellor·, (wastin),

was surmally appointed Chief J usticiar ot' {ffimwm

England· tonieuse.
Lougchamp had gained the entire con·

fideuce of the King, who stood by him to

the last. Richard wished to exalt him above

all competitore. ln addition to the two

great offices of ChiefJusticiar and Chaucel·

lor, Lougchamp sought the highest eccle·

siastical authority· The Archbishopriclrs

were filled3 but he despatched his agents

to Pope Clement‚ suliciting the Legatiou

of England. Richard supported the appli-

cation, aud the williug Pontiff granted the

boon,extending the legatine provinceof the

J usticiar, not merely to this Kiugdom, but

to Wales aud Ireland, or so much at least

of that island as was subject to the English

Crown. And about the same time, Richard

being then at Bayonne, he issued letters

patent, addressed to all his lieges, com·

manding them to obey the Bishop in all

things, even aa he the King himself was

⁴to be oheyed. This instrument, though

dated some months subsequently to Loug-

champ's appuiutment, seems in lact to he
the patent of the J usticiarship.
Lougclramp's character was oue of sin·
gular activity‚ which displayed itsell iu
every brauch of its administration. We
