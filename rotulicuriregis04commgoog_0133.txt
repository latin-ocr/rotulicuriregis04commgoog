INTRODUCTION. xcix

“ cerely desire, that by all my endeavours
“ God may be glorified, the truth, divine
“or human, vindicated, and the publick
‘¹ benehted:

‘⁴ Sic mihi contingat vivere, sicque mori.”

Such remarks arctoo instructive to be
omitted. They are the memorials of a
period when the indiyiduals most distin·
guished by knowledge, hy learning, or by
intellectus] eminence‚ were impressed with
the deep feeling of the duties resulting from
the important station whereunto they had
been called. Raised up as toachers, freely
dispensing the gista freely bestowed upon
them, secking neither present fame nor
worldly profit, but acting under an humhle
responsibility for the faithful use of the

talents entrustedto their stewardship. And
indeed, these sentimenta and principles

vill alone enable the inquirer to proceed
steadily and cheerfully, in labours, which

even humanly speaking, can never be
n'pened into harvest, until the hand that
sowed the seed is mouldering in the grave.
Pursued with any other motives, the dreary
annals of literary history will warn him how
little chance he has of escaping from the
most bitter vexation, sorrow, or despair.
