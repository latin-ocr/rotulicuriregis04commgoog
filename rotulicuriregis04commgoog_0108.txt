Raiph de Diceto, a most trusty and ac·
curate testimony, was not acquainted with
the history of the treasure, and commemo-
rates Peter Basil —and not Bertrom de
Gurdun—as the soldier by whose arrow
Richard was strichen. And the chronicle os
Dunstaple, the Annals of Margan, Matthew
Paris (or rather Roger Wendover), and
Walsingham, relating the story os the trea-
sure, all designate the same Peter Basil as
the' youth by whom the quarreil was dis·
charged.

The manuscript chronicie of Winchester
agrees with the last preceding authorities
in naming Peter Bosil as the man, but
differs from them by ascribing to this indi·
vidual the unhappy iate of Bertram de Gur·
dun, and yet with a variation. Maroadeus
surrendered the prisoner to Richard’s sister
Joan, Countess of StGiles, and she, and·
not Marcadeus, plucked out his eyes, and
caused him to suffer other horrible mutila·
tions and tortores, under which he expired.

The anonymous continuator of Geoffiy,
the Prior of Vigeois, aLimoisin Monastery,
places two knights, Peter Bru (perhaps '
Brun) and Peter Base, in the tower from
whence the missile proceeded: and adds,
that as it was reported, -a report which
he repeats without positively adopting it,-
Petchosil was the marksman.
