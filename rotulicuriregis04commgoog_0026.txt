xii INTRODUCTION.

Richard, when a discussion arose con-
cerning the aids granted to the King for
his ransom. RichardFitz Osbertexclaimed‚
“ ln recompense for the money taken from
“ me by the Chaucellor within the Tower
“ of London, ,Ι would lay out forty marks
‘⁶ to purchase a chain iu which the King
‘⁶ and his Chaucellor might be hanged.'’— (Noe c.)
There were others present who heard this
speech, Jordan the Tanner and Robert
Brand, without doubt the two true men
noticed, but not named, by Ralph de
Diceto, whose brief account of the trans·
action agrees, so far as it extends, with
the record. And they also vied with Richard
Fitz Osbert in his disloyalty. “Would that
‘⁶ the King might always remain where he
“now is,'’ quoth Jordan. ln this wish
Robert Brand cordially agreed-And,-
“ Come what wili,''- they all exclaimed-
“in London we never will have any other
‘⁶ King except our Mayor ;''- Henry Fitz
Ailwin of London Stone.

The Appellees, in due form, denied the
whole accusation “ de verbo in verbum‚''and
demanded the franchise of London, or the

: right possessed hythe citizens of defending
¹ themselves by compurgation, according to
the oldAnglo·Saxon laws of their ancestors.
Upon this plea, a day was given to them on
Sunday next aster thc feast of St. Kathc·'
