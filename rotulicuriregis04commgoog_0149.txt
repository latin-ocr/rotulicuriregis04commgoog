NOTES. cxlii

Pope was startled and scared and after expressiog his surprise
to the Cardinals in somewhst unseemly language he turned to
the Mons, and said, “ Brother, by St Peter you shall not wait
for my deado your petition is granted? and before Pope Inno-
oent again tasted food, he issued the Bull by which Archbishop
Hubert was authorized to restore the Monastery.

Now as this statement is wholly inconsistent with the Bull,
which ispreserved textually and entire, we must either admit
diat the documentis aforgery- and, at this period the practice
of fabrioatiog spurious Bulls prevailed exceedingly-or that
Matthew Paris, the Monlr of St. Albaos, was singularly
deceired

Itis probable that Hubert was the ward of Glanville. He thus
expresses himself on the Foundation Charter of West noreham.-
Omnibus Sanctae Matris Eeclesioe filiis, praesentibus et futuris,
Hubertus Dei gratia, Eboracensis eoelesioe Decanus, oeternsm in
Domino salutern. Sapientis est hiis, quae salute animae proficiunt,
dum potest, intendere et nansitoriis oeterna commutare. Quod
quidem intelligentes ..... quoddam coenobium Praemonstratensis
&dinis in feudo nostro, apud Derham fundavimus, pro salute
animas meoe, et patris et matris meoe, et Domini Ranalpln' de
Gramina et Bertoe uxoris ejus qui nos nutrierunt (Monostioom
vol. ri. 899.) -Geoffry Fitz Peter is one of the attesting wit·
nasses to the Charter.

Dioeto, osa-Tne good Bishop was thus lieensed by three
oonseeutire Metropolitans, the Venerable Anselm‚ noph, and
william de Corboyl It therefore appears that he did not eon-
sider that the sanction given by the Archbishop for the time
being, bound his suecessors.
