King’s brother, and hy all the Bishops,
Earls, Emona, and by tho Citizens of
London, that the Chief Justiciar should
be deposed from the govevnment ol the
Kingdom. Earl John was then proclaimed
“ Summus Rector totius Regni.’' This

The part taken by the Citizens of Lon-
don in this transaction is very remarkable.
